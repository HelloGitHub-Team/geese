## What is the Community Level

The HelloGitHub Community Level is a numerical system used to measure the contributions of open-source enthusiasts to the HelloGitHub community. It reflects the contributions and reputation of open-source enthusiasts within the community.

Everyone is encouraged to share interesting, beginner-friendly open-source projects, valuable and thoughtful project comments, and fair ratings. These actions will earn **contribution points**. Malicious project submissions or spam comments will result in deduction of contribution points.

## Level Benefits

The HelloGitHub Community Level is calculated and upgraded in real-time based on contribution points.

## Earning and Deducting Contribution Points

Community building relies on everyone. These rules are not shackles restricting freedom but the foundation of equality for all.

### 1. Rules for Earning Contribution Points

- **Recommend/Share Open Source Projects**: Click "Submit Project" on the homepage to share open-source projects on GitHub and earn **5 contribution points**.
- **Post Project Comments**: Click "Comment" on the project detail page to post your evaluation of the project. After posting a comment, you can earn **2 contribution points**. Comments selected as **Hot Comments** by the administrator can earn an additional **10 contribution points**. (Comments cannot be deleted or modified after posting)
- **Participate in Community Building**: [Contribute code](https://github.com/HelloGitHub-Team/geese), UI design, or [report bugs](https://hellogithub.yuque.com/forms/share/d268c0c0-283f-482a-9ac8-939aa8027dfb) for the community. Depending on the contribution, you can earn **1-50 contribution points**.

### 2. Rules for Deducting Contribution Points

- **Submit Useless/Malicious Content**: Posting projects and comments that include but are not limited to spam, personal attacks, political, pornographic, or discriminatory content will result in a deduction of **2-10 contribution points**. Serious cases will result in account suspension.

**We hope this will be a pure land for open-source enthusiasts, where everyone can passionately share and discuss open-source projects.**
