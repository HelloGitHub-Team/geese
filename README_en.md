  <br>HelloGitHub is a platform for discovering and sharing beginner-friendly open source projects<br>
</p>

"Geese" translated as "Jinghong" (meaning a fleeting glimpse), embodies a light and swift form, aiming to provide you with a "Jinghong"-like browsing experience through its refreshing and minimalist interface.

## Introduction

I wanted to create a home for those who enjoy open-source projects, so I built a lightweight open-source community using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This repository contains the source code for the [HelloGitHub](https://hellogithub.com/) Community.

This community offers interesting and beginner-friendly open-source projects across various **programming languages** and **categories**. Users can **discover/search/bookmark/comment/share** projects of interest here. They can also **like/submit/rate** projects to help outstanding open-source projects stand out. Around these projects, the community has gathered a group of open-source enthusiasts, skilled experts, and authors who love to share. Thanks to **open source**, we have met; perhaps the open-source spirit is a way to make friends!

Currently, the community **is live** for [online experience](https://hellogithub.com). If you encounter any issues or find bugs, you can [report them with one click](https://github.com/HelloGitHub-Team/geese/issues/new).
